        <p>
            I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to 
            where you are and who I am? <br>  
            As to where I am...   
            I was admittedly lost for a moment, 
            between Charing Cross and Holborn, 
            but I was saved by the bread
            shop on Southford Hill.   
            The only baker to use the certain French 
            glaze on their loaves a Brittany sage.  
            after that the carriage 
            fork left and right  
            until a tell-tale bump 
            at the Fleet conduit. 
            And as to who you are? that
            took every ounce of my not 
            inconsiderable experience.  
            The letters on your desk were 
            addressed to a Sir Thomas Rodrum.  
            Lord Chief Justice. That 
            would be the official title 
            Who you really are... is of 
            course another matter entirely. 
            Judging by the sacred 
            ox on your ring. 
            you're the secret head of the
            Temple of the Four Orders 
            in who's headquarters we now sit. 
            Located, Northwest corner 
            of St. James square I think.
            That's the mystery, the only mystery is to 
            why you bothered to blind fold me at all. <br>
            Yes... well, standard 
            procedure I suppose. 
            I dare say we have the
            right man, gentlemen. 
            </p>
        <p>
            I'm Ambassador Standish of America
            and Lord Coward, the home secretary. 
            I suppose you already have some 
            notion as to the practices of our order. <br>
            Yes. They are practically interesting. <br>
            Be as sceptical as you like. 
            but our secret system have steered the 
            world for the greater good for centuries.
            There danger is they can also be 
            used for more nefarious purposes.
            What some call the dark arts
            or practical magic. 
            We know you don't believe 
            in magic Mr. Holmes 
            We don't expect you 
            to share our faith
            merely our fears. <br>
            fear is the more 
            infectious condition.
            In this instance. 
            fear of your own child. 
            Blackwood is your son 
            You have the same irises, a rare dark 
            green, the diamond shaped hazel flex
            together with identical outer ears or pinner, which 
            are only past down through direct blood line
            which makes by 
            necessity either brothers
            or in this case, more 
            likely father and son. <br>
            Very few people are
            privy to that information.
            And we'd want to 
            keep it that way. 
            He was conceived 
            during one of our rituals. 
            His mother wasn't my wife. 
            But she shared our beliefs. 
            She was a powerful practitioner.  
            though not enough to 
            survive giving birth to him.   
            Death followed him 
            wherever he went. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Those five girls were not 
            the first to be butchered. <br> 
            He killed many more using
            them to enhance his powers.
            <br>
            No one could prove anything 
            of course, but we all knew. 
            <br>
            The boy was a curse. 
            <br> 
            We'd done our best to 
            stop him ourselves, but its not enough. 
            <br>
            His power grows daily. 
            <br>
            His resurrection is evidence of that.
            <br>
            But what he does next 
            will be far more dangerous. 
            <br>
            The secret lies in the book of spells. 
            This is the source of his power. 
            <br> 
            His going to raise a force that will 
            alter the very course of the world.
            <br> 
            I want you to find him and 
            stop him before he does.
            <br> 
            We'll give you any 
            assistance that we can.
            <br>
            As home secretary, I have a 
            considerable influence over the police.
            <br>
            - Oh, yes 
            - So... 
            <br>
            Name your price? 
            <br>
            Well, of great benefit to being a consulting 
            detective is that I can pick and choose my clients.
            Consider it done, I'll stop him.
            But not for you. And 
            certainly not for a price. 
            I do have a parting 
            query Sir Thomas.
            <br> 
            What is that? 
            <br>
            If the rest of his family's dead...
            how long do you expect to survive? 
            <br>
            Food for thought.
