                    And I stood upon the sand of the sea, 
                    and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, 
                    having seven heads and ten horns, 
                    and upon his horns ten crowns,
                    and upon his heads 
                    the name of blasphemy,
                </p>

                    and they worshipped the dragon 
                    which gave power unto the beast 
                    they worshipped 
                    the beast saying, 
                    Who is like the beast?

                    the beast which I just saw
                    had the body of a leopard,
                    but had feet of a bear and the 
                    mouth was the mouth of a lion.
                    The dragon gave his power unto the 
                    beast, and his seat and great authority.
